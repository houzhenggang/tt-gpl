README for the source code of the parts of TomTom GO software that fall under open source licenses, TomTom GO version 5.4* software (initially released with the TomTom ONE)

This is a document describing the distribution of the source code used on the TomTom GO, RIDER and ONE devices with version 5.4* of the navigation software, which falls under the GNU General Public License (the GPL). 

For more information about the GPL, see: 
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html

You can download a copy of the GPL here:

The GPL'ed source code used in TomTom GO falls into a number of categories: 
The compiler toolchain used to build all the software.
The Linux kernel for ARM, with modifications by TomTom.
BlueZ libraries and utilities.
Other third party software under GPL license.
TomTom software under GPL license.
A detailed description of these categories follows, including information on where to download this source code and/or its modifications. 

If you want to build your own software to run on the TomTom GO, RIDER or ONE devices, and need information or suggestions on how to do so, we suggest taking a look at the independent OpenTom project, on its website: http://www.opentom.org/. 
However, please note that TomTom has no control over the OpenTom project or its websites. Therefore TomTom does not officially support it, and takes no responsibility for any problems you might have using it. 

1. Toolchain

The compiler toolchain used to build all the software for the ARM Linux platform consists of a number of components:
GNU binutils 2.14.90.0.5

The assembler, linker and various other tools to operate on object files, libraries and executables. The official site for GNU binutils is: 
http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/

Whereas the base version we used comes from: 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/devel/binutils/binutils-2.14.90.0.5.tar.gz

The complete source code for our version can be found here: 
http://www.tomtom.com/gpl/binutils-2.14.90.0.5-20050405a.tar.gz

GNU gcc 3.3.4

The GNU C and C++ compilers. The official site for GNU gcc is: 
http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/

The base version we used can be downloaded from any GCC mirror site: 
http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/mirrors.html

The complete source code for our version can be found here: 
http://www.tomtom.com/gpl/gcc-3.3.4-20050405a.tar.gz

Diff against the base version: 
http://www.tomtom.com/gpl/gcc-3.3.4-20050405a.diff.gz
glibc 2.3.2

The GNU C runtime library. The official site for glibc is: 
http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/

The base version we used can be downloaded from any GNU mirror site: 
http://www.gnu.org/server/list-mirrors.html

The complete source code for our version can be found here: 
http://www.tomtom.com/gpl/glibc-2.3.2-20050405a.tar.gz

Diff against the base version: 
http://www.tomtom.com/gpl/glibc-2.3.2-20050405a.diff.gz
gdb 6.3

The GNU debugger. The official site for gdb is: 
http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/

The base version we used can be downloaded from any GNU mirror site: 
http://www.gnu.org/server/list-mirrors.html

The complete source code for our version can be found here: 
http://www.tomtom.com/gpl/gdb-6.3-20050502a.tar.gz

Diff against the base version: 
http://www.tomtom.com/gpl/gdb-6.3-20050502a.diff.gz
However, please note that building such a toolchain targeting ARM Linux, hosted on x86 Linux or another platform, with these separate components from scratch is NOT trivial, and can therefore not be supported by TomTom. However, we provide some precompiled, binary versions for your convenience. 
Linux x86 toolchain: 
http://www.tomtom.com/gpl/toolchain_redhat_gcc-3.3.4_glibc-2.3.2-20050428a.tar.gz

This version was built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 for x86, but it should also work on most other recent x86 Linux distributions, as long as you have a 2.4 or higher kernel, and glibc 2.3.2 or higher. You need to unpack it in a directory /usr/local/cross, and add /usr/local/cross/gcc-3.3.4_glibc-2.3.2/bin to your PATH environment variable to be able to use it.
Cygwin x86 toolchain: 
http://www.tomtom.com/gpl/toolchain_cygwin_gcc-3.3.4_glibc-2.3.2-20050428a.tar.gz

This version was built on Windows XP Professional, using a recent (March 2005) Cygwin installation, but it should also work on more recent Cygwin installations. You need to unpack it in a directory /usr/local/cross, and add /usr/local/cross/gcc-3.3.4_glibc-2.3.2/bin to your PATH environment variable to be able to use it.
If you really need to build your own toolchain from scratch, you are advised to use crosstool, which can be found here: 
http://kegel.com/crosstool/

Please note that TomTom does NOT support crosstool. 

2. The Linux Kernel

TomTom GO uses version 2.6.10 of the Linux kernel, with modifications by TomTom, which provide drivers for the specific TomTom GO hardware. Since the start of the 2.6.x kernel series, ARM Linux support has been in the main kernel source code, as released by Linus Torvalds. 

The official site for the Linux kernel is: 
http://www.kernel.org/

The base version we used can be downloaded from any kernel mirror site: 
http://www.kernel.org/mirrors/
